The adaptive filtering problem can be formulated mathematically as follows:

Given an input signal `x(n)` and a desired signal `d(n)`, the goal is to find a filter with adaptive coefficients `w(n)` such that the output signal `y(n) = w(n) * x(n)` approximates the desired signal `d(n)`. The error signal `e(n)` is defined as the difference between the desired signal and the output signal, i.e., `e(n) = d(n) - y(n)`.

The adaptive filter updates its coefficients iteratively based on the error signal and the input signal using a suitable adaptation algorithm. The adaptation algorithm adjusts the filter coefficients in such a way that the error signal is minimized, either in a mean square sense or in some other sense depending on the problem at hand.

The performance of the adaptive filter is usually measured by the mean square error (MSE) between the desired signal and the output signal, i.e., `MSE = E[|e(n)|^2]`, where `E[.]` denotes the expectation operator.

The choice of the adaptation algorithm depends on several factors, such as the complexity of the problem, the computational resources available, and the desired convergence rate and tracking ability. Some commonly used adaptation algorithms include the LMS algorithm, the RLS algorithm, and the Kalman filter.

In summary, the adaptive filtering problem involves finding a filter with adaptive coefficients that can approximate a desired signal from an input signal, by iteratively adjusting its coefficients based on the error signal. The choice of the adaptation algorithm depends on the problem requirements and constraints.
