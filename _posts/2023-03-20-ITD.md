# Introduction

Intrinsic Time Scale Decomposition (ITD) is a signal processing algorithm developed by Cohen and colleagues in the late 1990s. It decomposes a signal into a set of intrinsic time scales using a process of time-frequency reassignment. The algorithm is useful for extracting information from signals which are highly non-stationary, such as speech and music.

# Algorithm

The ITD algorithm works by first computing a spectrogram of the signal, which is a representation of the signal's frequency content over time. It then applies a nonlinear transformation to the spectrogram to form a reassigned spectrogram. This reassignment process is done by computing the time-frequency reassignment vector, which is the vector that points from the original frequency bin to the reassigned frequency bin.

The reassigned spectrogram is then decomposed into a set of intrinsic time scales. This is done by computing the instantaneous frequency of each frequency bin in the reassigned spectrogram. The instantaneous frequency is the rate of change of the frequency bin over time.

The algorithm then computes the instantaneous energy of each frequency bin in the reassigned spectrogram. The instantaneous energy is the rate of change of the energy in the frequency bin over time.

Finally, the algorithm computes the time-frequency distribution, which is the distribution of energy over time and frequency for each intrinsic time scale.

# Equations

The following equations define the ITD algorithm:

$$S(f,t) = \sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^\infty X[k]e^{-i2\pi f k \Delta t}$$

$$V(f,t) = \frac{\partial S(f,t)}{\partial t}$$

$$X_{\text{reassigned}}(f,t) = S(f,t) + \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}V(f,t)e^{-i2\pi f k \Delta t}dk$$

$$\Omega_i(f,t) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\partial X_{\text{reassigned}}(f,t)}{\partial f}$$

$$E_i(f,t) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\partial X_{\text{reassigned}}(f,t)}{\partial t}$$

$$P_i(f,t) = \frac{\Omega_i(f,t)E_i(f,t)}{\sqrt{\Omega_i(f,t)^2 + E_i(f,t)^2}}$$

# Python implementation

The following is a Python implementation of the ITD algorithm:

```python
# import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import stft

# define the signal
x = # your signal

# compute the spectrogram
f, t, S = stft(x)

# perform the reassignment
V = np.gradient(S, axis=1)
X_reassigned = S + np.sum(V*np.exp(-2*np.pi*1j*f*t), axis=0)

# compute the instantaneous frequency and energy
Omega = np.gradient(X_reassigned, axis=0)
E = np.gradient(X_reassigned, axis=1)

# compute the time-frequency distribution
P = Omega*E/(np.sqrt(Omega**2 + E**2))
```

# Example

The following is a simple example of using the ITD algorithm to decompose a signal into its intrinsic time scales. We will use a sine wave as our signal:

```python
# import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.signal import stft

# generate a sine wave
f = 1.0 # frequency (Hz)
fs = 10.0 # sampling rate (Hz)
t = np.arange(0.0, 1.0, 1.0/fs) # time vector
x = np.sin(2*np.pi*f*t) # signal

# compute the spectrogram
f, t, S = stft(x)

# perform the reassignment
V = np.gradient(S, axis=1)
X_reassigned = S + np.sum(V*np.exp(-2*np.pi*1j*f*t), axis=0)

# compute the instantaneous frequency and energy
Omega = np.gradient(X_reassigned, axis=0)
E = np.gradient(X_reassigned, axis=1)

# compute the time-frequency distribution
P = Omega*E/(np.sqrt(Omega**2 + E**2))

# plot the results
fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(8, 8))

axs[0].imshow(np.abs(S.T), aspect='auto', origin='lower')
axs[0].set_title('Spectrogram')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
axs[0].set_xlabel('Time (s)')

axs[1].imshow(np.abs(X_reassigned.T), aspect='auto', origin='lower')
axs[1].set_title('Reassigned Spectrogram')
axs[1].set_ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
axs[1].set_xlabel('Time (s)')

axs[2].imshow(np.abs(P.T), aspect='auto', origin='lower')
axs[2].set_title('Time-Frequency Distribution')
axs[2].set_ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
axs[2].set_xlabel('Time (s)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

# Conclusion

Intrinsic Time Scale Decomposition is a powerful signal processing algorithm for extracting information from non-stationary signals.
