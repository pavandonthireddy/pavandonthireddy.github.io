<p align="justify">Speech enhancement refers to the improvement in quality
and intelligibility of noise corrupted speech signals by
using supervised or unsupervised speech enhancement
methods. It is widely used as a pre-processing block in a lot
of applications like automatic speech recognizer and other
communication systems.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the last fifty decades, many algorithms have been
proposed about for speech enhancement. The typical
algorithms including spectral subtraction[1], minimum
mean square error (MMSE) estimation [2-4], Wiener
filtering [5-8], and subspace methods [9-13]. Spectral
Subtraction and Wiener filtering have been widely used for
enhancing speech because of their simplicity and ease of
implementation in single channel systems but they suffer
from the production of musical noise after enhancement
and is one of their major drawbacks. Signal subspace
approach [9-13], have shown to give a better compromise
between less residual noise and signal distortion of the
output signal, compared to the other existing techniques.</p>
