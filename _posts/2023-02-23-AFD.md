## Adaptive Fourier Decomposition (AFD) Algorithm

The Adaptive Fourier Decomposition (AFD) algorithm is a data-driven approach for analyzing nonlinear and non-stationary signals. It decomposes a signal into a sum of sinusoidal functions with time-varying frequencies, amplitudes, and phases, allowing for a more accurate representation of the underlying dynamics.

The AFD algorithm iteratively extracts sinusoidal components from the signal by fitting them to the residual signal, which is the original signal minus the sum of previously extracted components. The frequency, amplitude, and phase of each sinusoidal component are adjusted adaptively based on the residual signal, leading to a more accurate decomposition of the signal.

Mathematically, let x(t) be the signal to be decomposed. The AFD algorithm decomposes x(t) into a sum of K sinusoidal functions as follows:

$$x(t) = \sum_{k=1}^K A_k(t)  \sin(2\pi f_k(t)t + \phi_k(t)) + r(t)$$

where $A_k(t), f_k(t),$ and $\phi_k(t)$ are the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the k-th component at time t, respectively, and r(t) is the residual signal.

The AFD algorithm has many applications in signal processing, including feature extraction, noise reduction, and signal denoising.

## Python Implementation

Here is a Python implementation of the AFD algorithm using the NumPy library:

``` python
import numpy as np

def afd(x, n_components):
    # Initialize residual signal and extracted components
    r = x.copy()
    components = []
    
    for i in range(n_components):
        # Compute the Fourier transform of the residual signal
        f = np.fft.fft(r)
        
        # Find the frequency with the maximum amplitude
        f_max = np.argmax(np.abs(f))
        
        # Extract the sinusoidal component with the maximum amplitude
        component = np.sin(2*np.pi*f_max*np.arange(len(x))/len(x))
        components.append(component)
        
        # Remove the extracted component from the residual signal
        r -= component
        
    # Return the extracted components
    return components

```


###  The Brief Theory Foundation of AFD

AFD was motivated by the fact that Gabor's [12] method does not always produce analytic signals of non-negative instantaneous frequency (IF) [13]. To stick on the analytic signal idea, one has to accept that not all analytic signals have non-negative analytic phase derivative, or IF. This suggests seeking ways to approximate the given signal by appropriate basic signal with non-negative analytic IF, viz., monocomponents [13]. Progress has been made along this direction in which AFD is a core concept in the theory and practice. The brief explanation of AFD is provided below. 

AFD decomposes any given analytic signal of finite energy into a linear combination of a type of basic normal mono-component signals called modified Blaschke products. For a real-valued signal $f$ defined on the unit circle, AFD is to be applied to its Hardy space projection
$$
f^{+}=\frac{1}{2}(f+i H f)+\frac{c_0}{2},
$$
where $H f$ is the circular Hilbert transform of $f$ with the formula
$$
f^{+}\left(e^{i t}\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}<f_k, e_{a_k}>B_k\left(e^{i t}\right),
$$
where
$$
\begin{aligned}
& e_{a_k}\left(e^{i t}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{1-\left|a_k\right|^2}}{1-\bar{a}_k e^{i t}}, \\
& a_k=\operatorname{argmax}\left\{\sqrt{1-|b|^2}\left|f_k(b)\right|: b \in \text { the unit disc }\right\} \\
& B_k\left(e^{i t}\right)=e_{a_k}\left(e^{i t}\right) \prod_{l=1}^{k-1} \frac{e^{i t}-a_l}{1-\bar{a}_l e^{i t}}, \\
& f_k\left(e^{i t}\right)=\frac{f_{k-1}\left(e^{i t}\right)-<f_{k-1}, e_{a_{k-1}}>e_{a_{k-1}}\left(e^{i t}\right)}{\frac{e^{i t}-a_{k-1}}{1-\bar{a}_{k-1} e^t}}, k=1,2, \cdots \\
& f_0=f^{+} .
\end{aligned}
$$
The algorithm stops at the step $N$ such that
$$
\left\|f^{+}\right\|-\sum_{k=1}^N\left(1-\left|a_k\right|^2\right)\left|f_k\left(a_k\right)\right|^2<\varepsilon
$$
for the first time. The approximation to the original realvalued function $f$ is
$$
f=2 \operatorname{Re}\left\{\sum_{k=1}^N<f_k, e_{a_k}>B_k\right\}-c_0
$$


$$
=\sum_{k=1}^N \rho_k(t) \cos \theta_k(t)-c_0
$$
where
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \rho_k(t) e^{i \theta_k(t)}=2<f_k, e_{a_k}>B_k\left(e^{i t}\right) \\
& c_0=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f\left(e^{i t}\right) d t .
\end{aligned}
$$
Practically we take the initial value $a_1=0$.
