## About ITD

Intrinsic Scale Decomposition (ISD) is a signal processing technique that aims to decompose a given signal into a set of intrinsic scales or frequency bands, each of which captures different patterns and features of the signal.

ISD is based on the idea of multiresolution analysis, which involves analyzing a signal at multiple scales or resolutions to extract different levels of detail. However, unlike traditional multiresolution analysis techniques such as wavelet transforms or Fourier transforms, ISD uses an adaptive and data-driven approach to identify the intrinsic scales of the signal.

The basic idea behind ISD is to iteratively decompose a signal into two parts: a smooth part and a fluctuation part. The smooth part represents the low-frequency components of the signal, while the fluctuation part captures the high-frequency components. This decomposition is repeated at each scale, with the smooth part of the previous scale serving as the input for the next scale.

The ISD algorithm typically involves the following steps:

1.  Define an initial scale and compute the mean and standard deviation of the signal at that scale.
2.  Decompose the signal into a smooth part and a fluctuation part at that scale, using the mean and standard deviation as thresholds.
3.  Repeat the decomposition process at successively higher scales, using the smooth part of the previous scale as the input for the next scale.
4.  Stop the decomposition process when the remaining signal has a small amplitude or when a predefined number of scales have been reached.
5.  Reconstruct the signal by summing up the smooth parts of each scale.

The resulting decomposition provides a set of intrinsic scales or frequency bands that capture different patterns and features of the signal. These scales can be used for various signal processing tasks such as denoising, feature extraction, and pattern recognition.

ISD has been applied in various fields such as biomedical signal processing, image processing, and audio processing. However, it's worth noting that the effectiveness of ISD depends on the specific characteristics of the signal being analyzed and the choice of parameters used in the algorithm. Therefore, careful parameter tuning and validation are necessary to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the results.

        threshold = std * 2**(scale/2)
        smooth[i] = np.where(abs(signal - mean) < threshold, signal, mean)
        fluctuation[i] = signal - smooth[i]

        mean = np.mean(smooth[i])
        std = np.std(fluctuation[i])
        
        # Increment the scale for the next iteration
        scale += 1
    
    return smooth, fluctuation

Here's a brief explanation of the steps involved in the algorithm:

1.  The input signal is decomposed into a set of scales, with the number of scales specified by the `num_scales` parameter.
2.  The mean and standard deviation of the signal are computed at the initial scale.
3.  For each scale, the signal is decomposed into a smooth part and a fluctuation part using a threshold based on the standard deviation and the current scale.
4.  The mean and standard deviation are updated for the next scale using the smooth and fluctuation parts of the previous scale.
5.  The process is repeated for the specified number of scales.
6.  The output of the algorithm is a set of arrays containing the smooth and fluctuation parts of the signal at each scale.

Note that this is just one possible implementation of ISD, and there are many variations and extensions of the algorithm that can be used depending on the specific requirements of the application.
