# Introduction

The Iterative Filtering Decomposition (IFD) algorithm is used for decomposing nonlinear and non-stationary signals into different components.

The IFD algorithm involves iteratively high-pass filtering the original signal, using two complementary filters. The high-frequency components are retained, while the low-frequency components are discarded. This process is repeated iteratively, until the desired number of components are obtained.

The IFD algorithm is useful in various domains, including engineering, biology, finance, and geophysics. It has been used in the analysis of EEG signals, ECG signals, and seismic data.

In this article, we will provide an overview of the IFD algorithm, including the mathematical equations involved, a Python implementation of the algorithm, and a sample application.

# Mathematical Equations

The IFD algorithm involves iteratively applying two complementary filters to the original signal, to obtain a set of components. The two filters are defined as follows:

- The high-pass filter H(z) is given by:
$$H(z) = \frac{1 - z^{-2}}{1-\alpha z^{-1}}$$

- The low-pass filter L(z) is given by:
$$L(z) = \frac{\alpha (1+z^{-1})}{1-\alpha z^{-1}}$$

where $\alpha$ is the smoothing factor, which controls the cutoff frequency of the filters. It is typically set to a value near 1, to ensure that the filters do not remove too much of the signal.

To obtain the first component $C_1$ of the signal, we apply the high-pass filter $H(z)$ to the original signal $X(z)$, and obtain:
$$C_1 = H(z) X(z)$$

To obtain the second component $C_2$, we subtract $C_1$ from the original signal $X(z)$, and apply the high-pass filter $H(z)$ to the resulting signal. We obtain:
$$C_2 = H(z) [X(z) - C_1]$$

This process is repeated iteratively, to obtain the desired number of components. The $k$-th component $C_k$ is given by:
$$C_k = H(z) [X(z) - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} C_i]$$

# Python Implementation

We can implement the IFD algorithm in Python, using the following function:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import lfilter

def ifd(signal, alpha, num_components):
    components = []
    remaining_signal = signal
    for i in range(num_components):
        hi = np.array([1, 0, -1]) / (1 + alpha)
        hi[1] = -2 / (1 + alpha)
        li = np.array([alpha + 1, alpha + 1, 0]) / (2 + 2 * alpha)
        remaining_signal = signal - np.sum(components, axis=0)
        ci = lfilter(hi, li, remaining_signal)
        components.append(ci)
    return components
```

This function takes three arguments:

- `signal`: The original signal.
- `alpha`: The smoothing factor.
- `num_components`: The number of components to obtain.

The `ifd()` function returns a list of components, obtained using the IFD algorithm.

# Example

Let's consider a simple example, of generating a nonlinear and non-stationary signal, and using the IFD algorithm to decompose it into three components.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(0)

n = 200
t = np.linspace(0, 10, n)
signal = np.sin(t) + np.sin(3*t) + np.sin(5*t)
signal += np.random.normal(0, 0.5, n)

alpha = 0.985
num_components = 3

components = ifd(signal, alpha, num_components)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))

plt.subplot(num_components+1, 1, 1)
plt.plot(t, signal)
plt.title('Original signal')

for i in range(num_components):
    plt.subplot(num_components+1, 1, i+2)
    plt.plot(t, components[i])
    plt.title('Component {}'.format(i+1))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The above code generates a nonlinear and non-stationary signal, with a random noise component. It then applies the IFD algorithm to obtain three components.


As we can see, the IFD algorithm successfully decomposes the original signal into three components, which capture different frequency ranges of the signal.

# Conclusion

The Iterative Filtering Decomposition (IFD) algorithm is a useful tool for decomposing nonlinear and non-stationary signals into different components. It involves iteratively high-pass filtering the original signal using two complementary filters, until the desired number of components are obtained.
