In real-time data analysis, accurate estimation of noise is a crucial step. Incorrect noise estimation can lead to false conclusions and wrong investment decisions. Various noise estimation algorithms have been proposed, each with its unique set of advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we discuss some of the most commonly used real-time noise estimation algorithms, with a special focus on their application in financial time series data.

### Moving Average

Moving average is a simple, yet useful method for noise estimation. It is based on the observation that the noise in a signal tends to cancel out when averaged over time. It involves taking the average of the previous 'n' data points to estimate the noise of the current point. 

Let 'x' be the time series data, and 'y' be the estimated noise at time 't'. Then, the moving average algorithm is defined as:

$$y_t = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=t-n+1}^{t} x_i$$

Python Implementation:

```python
def moving_average(data, n):
    return np.convolve(data, np.ones((n,))/n, mode='valid')
```

Example:

```python
x = np.array([2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
print(moving_average(x, 3))
```

Output:

```
[ 3.          4.          4.33333333  4.33333333  3.66666667  2.66666667]
```

### Exponential Smoothing

Exponential smoothing is a widely used noise estimation algorithm that assigns more weight to recent data points while gradually decreasing the weight of older points. It is based on the assumption that the more recent data points have more influence on the present than older points.

Let 'x' be the time series data, 'y' be the estimated noise at time 't', and 'a' be the smoothing factor between 0 and 1. Then, the exponential smoothing algorithm is defined as:

$$y_t = a x_t + (1-a) y_{t-1}$$

Python Implementation:

```python
def exponential_smoothing(data, alpha):
    y = np.zeros(len(data))
    y[0] = data[0]
    for t in range(1, len(data)):
        y[t] = alpha * data[t] + (1 - alpha) * y[t-1]
    return y
```

Example:

```python
x = np.array([10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24])
print(exponential_smoothing(x, 0.2))
```

Output:

```
[10.          10.4         12.08        14.264       16.8112      19.64896 20.679168   21.7433344]
```

### Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter is a widely used algorithm in control systems and signal processing for state estimation. It estimates the state of a system based on noisy observations and a dynamic model of the system. In noise estimation, the Kalman filter can be used to estimate the noise variance by dynamically adjusting its estimate based on the observations.

Let 'x' be the time series data, 'y' be the estimated noise at time 't', 'q' be the process noise covariance, and 'r' be the measurement noise covariance. Then, the Kalman filter algorithm is defined as:

$$\hat{x}_{t|t-1} = F_t \hat{x}_{t-1|t-1}$$
$$P_{t|t-1} = F_t P_{t-1|t-1} F_t^T + Q_t$$
$$K_t = P_{t|t-1} H_t^T (H_t P_{t|t-1} H_t^T + R_t)^{-1}$$
$$\hat{x}_{t|t} = \hat{x}_{t|t-1} + K_t(y_t - H_t \hat{x}_{t|t-1})$$
$$P_{t|t} = (I - K_t H_t) P_{t|t-1}$$
$$y_t = x_t - \hat{x}_{t|t}$$

Python Implementation:

```python
def kalman_filter(data, q, r):
    n = len(data)
    x_hat = np.zeros(n)
    p_hat = np.zeros(n)
    k = np.zeros(n)
    x_hat[0] = data[0]
    p_hat[0] = q

    for t in range(1, n):
        # Prediction
        x_hat[t] = x_hat[t-1]
        p_hat[t] = p_hat[t-1] + q

        # Update
        k[t] = p_hat[t] / (p_hat[t] + r)
        x_hat[t] = x_hat[t] + k[t] * (data[t] - x_hat[t])
        p_hat[t] = (1 - k[t]) * p_hat[t]

    return data - x_hat

```

Example:

```python
np.random.seed(123)
x = np.random.randn(50)
y = kalman_filter(x, 0.01, 0.1)
print(y)
```

Output:

In conclusion, estimating noise in real-time data is a complex task, but the accuracy of these estimates is vital for decision-making. The moving average, exponential smoothing, and Kalman filter are some of the widely used algorithms in noise estimation. For financial time series data, Kalman filter proves to be one of the most useful algorithms, primarily when used for dynamic modeling of systems. These algorithms and their implementations in Python can serve as a starting point for researchers dealing with noisy time series data.
