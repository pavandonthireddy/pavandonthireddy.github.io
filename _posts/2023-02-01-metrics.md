## Spectral flatness

This feature is called the spectral flatness (F), which is defined as

$$
F_n=10 \log _{10}\left(\frac{m_a}{m_g}\right),
$$

where $m_{a}$ and $m_{g}$ respectively, denote the arithmetic and geometric means of the noisy speech spectrum. The spectral flatness is a measure of the noisiness of spectrum and is a good feature in voiced / uncoiced detection [8]. A low spectral flatness indicates that the spectral power is concentrated in a relatively small number of bands, which behaves more like voice frames. However, a high spectral flatness shows that the spectrum power is more uniform in different frequency bands, and appears relatively flat and smooth, which appears more likely as noise.


The following global measures are utilized to indicate the corresponding characteristics of estimated trend $\hat{T}_{t}$

$$y(x) = T(x)+\epsilon (x)$$

$$
\text{    Smoothness  :} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} ( \Delta^{2}\hat{T}_{t} )^2}
$$


$$
\text{    Fidelity  :} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t=1}^{N} (y_{t} - \hat{T}_{t})^2}
$$

$$
\text{    Bias  :   } \mathbb{E}(\vert T_{t}-\hat{T}_{t}\vert)
$$
