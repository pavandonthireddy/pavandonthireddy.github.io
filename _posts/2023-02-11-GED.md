Generalized eigenvalue decomposition is a mathematical technique that involves finding a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues for two matrices, typically a symmetric matrix and a positive definite matrix. 

Given two matrices A and B, the generalized eigenvalue decomposition finds a set of eigenvectors x and corresponding eigenvalues λ that satisfy the equation:

$$Ax = \lambda Bx$$

where x is a non-zero vector. In other words, the eigenvalues are scalar values that determine how the eigenvectors of A are scaled when multiplied by B.

This decomposition is useful in a variety of applications, including solving systems of linear equations, analyzing linear transformations, and solving partial differential equations. The generalized eigenvalue decomposition can also be used to determine the stability of a system in control theory.

The generalized eigenvalue decomposition can be expressed in the form of a matrix equation as follows:

$$AX = BX\Lambda$$

where X is a matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of A, and Λ is a diagonal matrix whose entries are the corresponding eigenvalues of A. 

The columns of X are typically normalized to have unit length, so that $X^T B X = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. 

The generalized eigenvalue decomposition can be computed using various algorithms, including the QR algorithm and the Jacobi algorithm.
