# Introduction

Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) is a time-frequency analysis tool used for decomposing signals into localized oscillatory modes. It is a data-driven approach for signal processing that does not require any prior knowledge about the signal or any specific wavelet basis. EWT is particularly useful for non-stationary signals that exhibit time-varying statistical properties. 

EWT is based on the principle of finding local oscillations in the signal using an adaptive wavelet that varies with the signal itself. It is a versatile technique that has several variants, each with its unique properties and applications. This article provides an overview of some of the most commonly used variants of EWT and their mathematical formulations. Python implementations and examples are also included.

# Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT)

EWT decomposes a signal `f(t)` into a set of oscillatory modes `m_i(t)` that represent localized oscillations in the signal with different time and frequency characteristics. The EWT process involves the following steps:

1. Compute the Hilbert Spectrum of the signal `f(t)` using the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT).
2. Estimate the local frequency and bandwidth of each mode using an adaptive wavelet.
3. Perform a weighted Fourier transform of each mode to obtain the oscillatory component and its corresponding scale.

The Empirical Wavelet Function (EWF) at scale `a` and position `t` is defined as:

$$
\Psi_{a, t}(x) = \frac{1}{|a|^{1/2}} \Psi\left(\frac{x-t}{a}\right)
$$

where `Psi` is an analyzing wavelet function, and `a` is the scale parameter that varies with time. The local oscillatory mode `m_i(t)` is obtained by convolving the signal `f(t)` with the EWF `Psi_a,t(x)`:

$$
m_i(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \Psi_{a_i, t_i}(x-t) dx
$$

where `a_i` and `t_i` are the scale and position parameters estimated for each mode, respectively. 

The Hilbert Spectrum of the signal `f(t)` is obtained using HHT, which involves the following steps:

1. Decompose `f(t)` into a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD).
2. Compute the Hilbert transform of each IMF.
3. Compute the instantaneous frequency and amplitude of each mode using the Hilbert Transform.

The Hilbert Transform of a signal `f(t)` is defined as:

$$
H[f(t)] = \frac{1}{\pi t} PV\!\!\!\!\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{f(x)}{t-x}dx
$$

where `PV` denotes the principal value integral.

Once the Hilbert Spectrum is obtained, EWT can be used to decompose the signal `f(t)` into a set of oscillatory modes `m_i(t)`.

# Variants of EWT

EWT has several variants that differ in the wavelet function used, the thresholding method used to estimate the local frequency and bandwidth, and the weighting scheme used to obtain the oscillatory component. Some commonly used variants are:

## Fourier-Based Empirical Wavelet Transform (FWT)

FWT is a simplified version of EWT that uses the Fourier transform instead of the adaptive wavelet to estimate the local frequency and bandwidth. FWT involves the following steps:

1. Compute the Fourier transform of the signal `f(t)`.
2. Compute the magnitude and phase of each frequency component.
3. Estimate the local frequency as the derivative of the phase with respect to time.
4. Estimate the local bandwidth as the inverse of the second derivative of the phase with respect to time.
5. Apply a weighting function to obtain the oscillatory component.

The Fourier-Based Empirical Wavelet Function is defined as:

$$
\Psi_{a, t}(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}|a|} e^{iwx}e^{-\frac{(x-t)^2}{2a^2}}
$$

where `a` is the scale parameter, `t` is the position parameter, and `w` is the frequency parameter. The local frequency and bandwidth at position `t` are estimated as the instantaneous frequency and bandwidth of the Fourier component at that position, respectively.

## Complex Empirical Wavelet Transform (CEWT)

CEWT is a variant of EWT that uses a complex wavelet to obtain the oscillatory modes. The complex wavelet is defined as:

$$
\Psi(x) = e^{iwx} \phi(x)
$$

where `w` is the frequency parameter, and `phi(x)` is a real-valued analyzing function. CEWT involves the following steps:

1. Compute the Hilbert Spectrum of the signal `f(t)` using HHT.
2. Approximate the Hilbert Spectrum as a sum of complex signals using a complex wavelet transform.
3. Apply a thresholding method to obtain a set of Hilbert ridges, which represent the oscillatory modes.
4. Apply a weighting function to obtain the oscillatory component.

## Synchrosqueezing Transform (SST)

SST is a variant of EWT that uses a reassignment method to obtain the oscillatory modes. SST involves the following steps:

1. Compute the Hilbert Spectrum of the signal `f(t)` using HHT.
2. Reassign the energy of each component of the Hilbert Spectrum to the corresponding frequency and time.
3. Apply a thresholding method to obtain a set of Hilbert ridges, which represent the oscillatory modes.
4. Apply a weighting function to obtain the oscillatory component.

# Python Implementation

The following Python code provides an example of how to implement FWT using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

def fwt(data, scales):
    # Compute the Fourier transform of the data
    fft_data = np.fft.fft(data)
    # Compute the frequency and phase of each component
    freq = np.fft.fftfreq(len(data), d=1/sampling_rate)
    phase = np.angle(fft_data)
    # Compute the local frequency and bandwidth of each mode
    df = np.gradient(phase)
    ddf = np.gradient(df)
    local_freq = freq + df / (2*np.pi)
    local_bandwidth = 1 / (np.abs(ddf) + epsilon)
    # Compute the Fourier-Based Empirical Wavelet Function Psi
    t = np.arange(len(data))
    Psi = np.exp(1j*2*np.pi*freq[:, None]*t) * np.exp(-0.5*((t[:, None] - scales[None, :])/local_bandwidth)**2)
    # Compute the amplitude and oscillatory component
    amplitude = np.abs(fft_data)
    oscillatory_component = np.real(np.sum(amplitude[:, None] * Psi, axis=0))
    return oscillatory_component
```

This code takes as input an array of signal data `data` and an array of scale parameters `scales`, and returns the Fourier-based Empirical Wavelet Transform of the signal. The code computes the Fourier transform of the signal and estimates the local frequency and bandwidth of each mode using the Fourier coefficients. It then computes the Fourier-based Empirical Wavelet Function Psi and applies it to obtain the oscillatory component of each mode.
