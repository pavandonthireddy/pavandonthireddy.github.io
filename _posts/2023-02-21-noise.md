## Additive noise

Additive noise can be modeled as a random process that is independent of the original signal. Let x(t) be the original signal and n(t) be the additive noise, then the noisy signal y(t) is given by:

$$y(t) = x(t) + n(t)$$

where n(t) is a random process with mean zero and variance sigma^2.

## Impulsive noise

Impulsive noise is characterized by sudden spikes or drops in the signal amplitude. It can be modeled as a random process that is uncorrelated with the original signal. Let x(t) be the original signal and d(t) be the impulsive noise, then the noisy signal y(t) is given by:

$$y(t) = x(t) + d(t)$$

where d(t) is a random process with probability density function f(d(t)).

## Gaussian noise

Gaussian noise is also known as white noise and is characterized by a normal distribution. It can be modeled as a random process that is uncorrelated with the original signal. Let x(t) be the original signal and w(t) be the Gaussian noise, then the noisy signal y(t) is given by:

$$y(t) = x(t) + w(t)$$

where w(t) is a random process with mean zero and variance sigma^2.

## Shot noise

Shot noise is caused by the discrete nature of electrical charge and can be modeled as a Poisson process. Let x(t) be the original signal and s(t) be the shot noise, then the noisy signal y(t) is given by:

$$y(t) = x(t) + s(t)$$

where s(t) is a Poisson process with mean lambda.

## Thermal noise

Thermal noise is caused by the random motion of electrons in a conductor due to temperature fluctuations. It can be modeled as a Gaussian process with mean zero and variance proportional to the temperature. Let x(t) be the original signal and z(t) be the thermal noise, then the noisy signal y(t) is given by:

$$y(t) = x(t) + z(t)$$

where z(t) is a Gaussian process with mean zero and variance proportional to the temperature.

## Quantization noise

Quantization noise is introduced when an analog signal is converted to a digital signal. It can be modeled as a uniform quantization error. Let x(t) be the original signal and q(t) be the quantization noise, then the noisy signal y(t) is given by:

$$y(t) = Q[x(t)] + q(t)$$

where Q[x(t)] is the quantized version of the original signal x(t) and q(t) is a uniform quantization error. 

## White noise

White noise is a type of noise that has a flat power spectral density, meaning that it has equal power at all frequencies. It can be modeled as a Gaussian process with mean zero and constant variance sigma^2. Let w(t) be the white noise process, then the power spectral density S(f) is given by:

$$S(f) = \sigma^2$$

where f is frequency.

## Pink noise

Pink noise is a type of colored noise that has equal power in each octave. It is also known as 1/f noise, because its power spectral density is proportional to 1/f, where f is frequency. Pink noise can be modeled as a filtered white noise process. Let p(t) be the pink noise process, then its power spectral density S(f) is given by:

$$S(f) \propto \frac{1}{f}$$

where f is frequency.

## Brownian noise

Brownian noise is a type of colored noise that has a power spectral density that is proportional to f^2, where f is frequency. It can be modeled as the integral of white noise over time. Let b(t) be the Brownian noise process, then its power spectral density S(f) is given by:

$$S(f) \propto f^2$$

where f is frequency.

## Blue noise

Blue noise is a type of colored noise that has a power spectral density that is proportional to f, where f is frequency. It is also known as azure noise or transient noise. Blue noise can be modeled as the derivative of Brownian noise with respect to time. Let u(t) be the blue noise process, then its power spectral density S(f) is given by:

$$S(f) \propto f$$

where f is frequency.

## Violet noise

Violet noise is a type of colored noise that has a power spectral density that is proportional to f^(-2), where f is frequency. It is also known as purple noise or differentiated white noise. Violet noise can be modeled as the second derivative of Brownian noise with respect to time. Let v(t) be the violet noise process, then its power spectral density S(f) is given by:

$$S(f) \propto f^{-2}$$

where f is frequency.
