# Iterative Kalman Filter

The Kalman Filter is a widely-used algorithm for estimating the state of a system based on noisy measurements. It provides an optimal solution for linear systems with Gaussian noise. However, for non-linear systems, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used. In some cases, the EKF may not perform well due to its assumption of the Gaussian distribution of noise.

The Iterative Kalman Filter (IKF) is an improvement over the EKF, which iteratively linearizes the non-linear system around the current estimate of the state. The IKF uses a Taylor series expansion to linearize the non-linear system and estimates the state using the linearized system. The process is then repeated until convergence.

The algorithm for the Iterative Kalman Filter is as follows:

1.  Initialize the state estimate $\hat{x}_{0|0}$ and the covariance matrix $P_{0|0}$.
2.  Repeat for each time step $k$:
    1.  Linearize the non-linear system around the current state estimate:
        
        $\begin{aligned} F_k &= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\bigg|_{\hat{x}_{k|k-1}} \ H_k &= \frac{\partial h}{\partial x}\bigg|_{\hat{x}_{k|k-1}} \ \end{aligned}$
        
    2.  Predict the state estimate and the covariance matrix:
        
        $\begin{aligned} \hat{x}_{k|k-1} &= f(\hat{x}_{k-1|k-1}) \ P_{k|k-1} &= F_k P_{k-1|k-1} F_k^T + Q_k \ \end{aligned}$
        
    3.  Compute the Kalman gain:
        
        $K_k = P_{k|k-1} H_k^T (H_k P_{k|k-1} H_k^T + R_k)^{-1}$
        
    4.  Update the state estimate and the covariance matrix:
        
        $\begin{aligned} \hat{x}_{k|k} &= \hat{x}_{k|k-1} + K_k (y_k - h(\hat{x}_{k|k-1})) \ P_{k|k} &= (I - K_k H_k) P_{k|k-1} \ \end{aligned}$
        

The IKF iteratively performs steps 2-4 until the state estimate converges. The algorithm converges if the difference between two consecutive state estimates is below a certain threshold.

The IKF is more computationally expensive than the EKF, but it provides better performance for non-linear systems with non-Gaussian noise.
