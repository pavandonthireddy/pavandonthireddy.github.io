A matrix pencil is a mathematical construct that consists of two matrices, typically denoted as A and B, that are related by a parameter, often denoted as λ. The matrix pencil can be written as:

$$(A - \lambda B)$$

where λ is the parameter and A and B are two matrices of the same size. The matrix pencil is used in many areas of mathematics and engineering, including control theory, linear algebra, and numerical analysis.

The matrix pencil is often used to solve eigenvalue problems, which involve finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a matrix. In particular, the generalized eigenvalue problem can be formulated as a matrix pencil problem, where the matrices A and B are symmetric and positive definite. The solutions to this problem are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix pencil, which can be used to solve a variety of linear algebraic problems.

The matrix pencil can also be used to represent linear operators and to study the behavior of dynamical systems. In control theory, for example, the matrix pencil is used to describe the transfer function of a linear system, which relates the input and output of the system.

The matrix pencil is a powerful mathematical tool that has applications in many areas of mathematics and engineering. It allows us to represent and solve a wide range of problems involving matrices and linear systems.
