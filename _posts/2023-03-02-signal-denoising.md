<p align="justify">Signal denoising is one of the classic problems in signal processing research. Especially in the
additional Gaussian white noise condition, a variety of algorithms,such as median filtering, Wiener
filtering, wavelet denoising and denoising based on EMD are proposed. The wavelet method can
analyze the non-stationary and non-linear time series,but the basic wavelet function and the
thresholding are not the same at different scales.EMD is an adaptive method to decompose any signal
into a collection of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs).Although the introduction of the EMD carry on a
conceptual advance in time-frequency-energy analysis for non-stationary and nonlinear signals,it still
has some practical limitations that reduce its practical utility and may cause inaccuracies in
demonstrating signal dynamics.For example,its use of splines to obtain the IMF causes the EMD to
inherit all the well-know difficulties associated with this form of interpolation.</p>

1.  Wavelet denoising: Wavelet denoising is a widely used method for removing noise from signals. It uses wavelet transforms to decompose the signal into different scales and removes noise at each scale. The denoised signal is then reconstructed from the remaining wavelet coefficients.
    
2.  Singular value decomposition (SVD) denoising: SVD denoising is a technique that uses matrix decomposition to extract the signal from the noisy data. It involves decomposing the data matrix into three matrices, which can be used to filter out noise and reconstruct the signal.
    
3.  Principal component analysis (PCA) denoising: PCA denoising is a method that uses statistical analysis to extract the signal from the noisy data. It involves decomposing the data into its principal components, which can be used to filter out noise and reconstruct the signal.
    
4.  Non-local means denoising: Non-local means denoising is a method that exploits the redundancy in the signal to remove noise. It involves finding similar patches in the signal and using them to estimate the noise-free signal.
    
5.  Total variation denoising: Total variation denoising is a method that uses the total variation of the signal to remove noise. It involves minimizing the total variation of the signal subject to a constraint that the noisy signal must match the original signal at some locations.
