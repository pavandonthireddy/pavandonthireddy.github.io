Signal enhancement algorithms are used to improve the quality of signals by reducing noise, increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and enhancing the overall quality of the signal. Here are some common signal enhancement algorithms:

## 1. Wiener Filter

The Wiener filter is a linear filter that minimizes the mean square error between the original signal and the filtered signal. It is based on the assumption that the original signal and the noise are uncorrelated, and the noise is additive and Gaussian.

The output of the Wiener filter is given by:

$$Y(k)=\frac{H^*(k)S(k)}{|H(k)|^2S(k)+N(k)}$$

where,

- Y(k) is the filtered signal at frequency k.
- H(k) is the frequency response of the filter.
- S(k) is the power spectral density (PSD) of the original signal.
- N(k) is the PSD of the noise.

The Wiener filter can be implemented in the time domain using convolution.

## 2. Kalman Filter

The Kalman filter is a recursive filter that estimates the state of a system based on noisy measurements. It is widely used in control theory and signal processing.

The state of the system is modeled as a linear combination of the previous state and the input:

$$x_k=F_kx_{k-1}+B_ku_k$$

where,

- x_k is the state of the system at time k.
- F_k is the state transition matrix.
- B_k is the input matrix.
- u_k is the input at time k.

The measurement is modeled as a linear combination of the state and the measurement noise:

$$z_k=H_kx_k+v_k$$

where,

- z_k is the measurement at time k.
- H_k is the measurement matrix.
- v_k is the measurement noise.

The Kalman filter estimates the state of the system at each time step and updates the estimate based on the new measurement. The output of the Kalman filter is the estimated state of the system.

## 3. Wavelet Denoising

Wavelet denoising is a signal processing technique that uses wavelet transform to remove noise from a signal. The basic idea is to transform the signal into the wavelet domain, where the noise and the signal have different characteristics.

The wavelet coefficients are thresholded to remove the noise. The thresholding can be hard or soft. In hard thresholding, coefficients below a certain threshold are set to zero. In soft thresholding, coefficients below a certain threshold are shrunk towards zero.

The inverse wavelet transform is then applied to obtain the denoised signal.

The equation for hard thresholding is:

$$W_{i,j} = \begin{cases} W_{i,j}, & \text{if } |W_{i,j}| > T \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

where,

- W_{i,j} is the wavelet coefficient at scale i and position j.
- T is the threshold.

The equation for soft thresholding is:

$$W_{i,j} = \text{sign}(W_{i,j})(|W_{i,j}|-T)_+$$

where,

- W_{i,j} is the wavelet coefficient at scale i and position j.
- T is the threshold.
- (x)_+ = max(0,x).

## 4. Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

Independent component analysis (ICA) is a signal processing technique that separates a multivariate signal into independent, non-Gaussian components. The basic idea is to find a linear transformation of the signal that maximizes
