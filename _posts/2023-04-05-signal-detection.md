# Introduction

The signal detection problem is a fundamental issue in signal processing, which involves distinguishing between "signal" and "noise" in a given data set. While the term "signal" is often used in the context of communication signals, it can refer to any meaningful pattern or structure in the data, such as a periodic pattern in a traffic flow dataset that indicates the presence of a traffic light.

Real-time signal detection is particularly challenging since the data is constantly changing, and the algorithms must operate within tight time constraints. This article provides an overview of the key signal detection algorithms and their variants in real-time applications, including their mathematical formulations and Python implementations.

# Signal Detection Algorithms

Signal detection algorithms classify input data as "signal" or "noise," often using a statistical approach to distinguish between the two. The most popular algorithms for time-series data include:

## Thresholding Method

The thresholding method is a simple yet effective way to detect signals based on a threshold value. If a time-series value exceeds the threshold, the data is classified as "signal"; otherwise, it is classified as "noise." The threshold can be static or dynamic, depending on the application.

The mathematical formulation for thresholding is as follows:

`x(n) = { 1, if s(n) > T; 0, otherwise }`

Where `s(n)` is the input signal and `T` is the threshold value.

### Python Implementation

```python
def thresholding(signal, threshold):
    # Returns a binary signal where 1 indicates a signal value above the threshold, and 0 indicates noise.
    return [1 if x > threshold else 0 for x in signal]
```

### Example

Consider an input signal `s = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 1, 0, -1, -3]`. We can apply thresholding with a threshold value of `2` to identify signal values.

```python
>>> thresholding(s, 2)
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Moving Average Method

The moving average method smooths the input signal and detects signals based on the distance between the smoothed signal and the original signal. The method involves calculating the average of the last `N` data points in the time-series, where `N` is a user-defined window size. The difference between the current value and the moving average is compared against a threshold value. If the difference is greater than the threshold, the data is classified as a signal.

The mathematical formulation for moving average method is:

`x(n) = { 1, if |s(n) - y(n)| > T; 0, otherwise }`

Where `s(n)` is the input signal, `y(n)` is the moving average signal, and `T` is the threshold value.

### Python Implementation

```python
def moving_average(signal, window_size, threshold):
    # Returns a binary signal where 1 indicates a signal value above the threshold, and 0 indicates noise.
    ma = np.convolve(signal, np.ones((window_size,))/window_size, mode='valid')
    ma_diff = np.abs(signal[window_size-1:] - ma)
    ma_diff = np.concatenate([np.zeros(window_size-1), ma_diff])
    return [1 if x > threshold else 0 for x in ma_diff]
```

### Example

Consider the same input signal `s` as above. We can apply the moving average method with a window size of `3` and a threshold value of `1` to identify signal values.

```python
>>> moving_average(s, 3, 1)
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Autocorrelation Method

The autocorrelation method is based on the principle that the signal should be periodic if it contains a signal component that is repeated over time. The method computes the autocorrelation of the time series signal for multiple lag values and identifies signals based on the maximum value of the autocorrelation.

The mathematical formulation for the autocorrelation method is:

`x(n) = { 1, if rxx(k) > T; 0, otherwise }`

Where `rxx(k)` is the autocorrelation for lag `k` and `T` is the threshold value.

### Python Implementation

```python
def autocorrelation(signal, threshold):
    # Returns a binary signal where 1 indicates a signal value above the threshold, and 0 indicates noise.
    nx = len(signal)
    autocorrelations = np.zeros(nx)
    for k in range(nx):
        autocorrelations[k] = np.corrcoef(signal[:-k], signal[k:])[0, 1]
    return [1 if x > threshold else 0 for x in autocorrelations]
```

### Example

Consider the same input signal `s` as above. We can apply the autocorrelation method with a threshold value of `0.5` to identify signal values.

```python
>>> autocorrelation(s, 0.5)
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

# Real-time Variants

Real-time signal detection requires that the algorithms operate efficiently and effectively within the constraints of the system. The following are some variants of the signal detection algorithms that are suitable for real-time applications.

## Sliding Window Method

The sliding window method is a real-time variant of the moving average method, which computes the moving average for a fixed window size as the data arrives. The window is moved to the right with each new data point, and the moving average is computed again. The method detects signals based on the difference between the current value and the moving average using a threshold.

The mathematical formulation is the same as the moving average method.

### Python Implementation

```python
def sliding_window(signal, window_size, threshold):
    # Returns a binary signal where 1 indicates a signal value above the threshold, and 0 indicates noise.
    ma = np.zeros(len(signal)-window_size+1)
    for i in range(window_size-1, len(signal)):
        ma[i-window_size+1] = np.mean(signal[i-window_size+1:i+1])
    ma_diff = np.abs(signal[window_size-1:] - ma)
    return [1 if x > threshold else 0 for x in ma_diff]
```

### Example

Consider the input signal `s = [2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 2]`. We can apply the sliding window method with a window size of `3` and a threshold value of `1` to identify signal values.

```python
>>> sliding_window(s, 3, 1)
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
```

## Recursive Moving Average Method

The recursive moving average method is a real-time variant of the moving average method that computes the moving average as new data points are received. The method uses a recursive formula to update the moving average, which allows for efficient and real-time processing of data. The method detects signals based on the difference between the current value and the moving average using a threshold.

The mathematical formulation is the same as the moving average method.

### Python Implementation

```python
def recursive_moving_average(signal, threshold):
    # Returns a binary signal where 1 indicates a signal value above the threshold, and 0 indicates noise.
    ma = signal[0]
    for i in range(1, len(signal)):
        ma = ma + (signal[i] - ma) / (i+1)
    ma_diff = np.abs(signal - ma)
    return [1 if x > threshold else 0 for x in ma_diff]
```

### Example

Consider the same input signal `s` as before. We can apply the recursive moving average method with a threshold value of `1` to identify signal values.

```python
>>> recursive_moving_average(s, 1)
[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

## CUSUM Method

The CUSUM method is a real-time variant of the thresholding method that detects changes in the signal over time. The method computes the cumulative sum of the differences between the actual signal and the expected signal. The expected signal is determined by an initial reference value, which is updated after each data point is received. The method detects signals based on the cumulative sum exceeding a threshold.

The mathematical formulation for the CUSUM method is:

`x(n) = { 1, if cumsum(n) - k > T; 0, otherwise }`

Where `cumsum(n)` is the cumulative sum of the differences between the actual signal and the expected signal up to time `n`. `k` is an offset threshold, and `T` is a drift threshold.

### Python Implementation

```python
def cusum(signal, k, drift):
    # Returns a binary signal where 1 indicates a signal value above the threshold, and 0 indicates noise.
    expected = signal[0]
    cumsum = 0
    for i in range(1, len(signal)):
        expected += k
        cumsum += signal[i] - expected
        if cumsum > drift:
            cumsum = 0
            return [1 if j <= i else 0 for j in range(len(signal))]
    return [0] * len(signal)
```

### Example

Consider the input signal `s = [1.2, 1.5, 1.3, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.8, 1.5, 1.2]`. We can apply the CUSUM method with `k = 0.2` and `drift = 0.4` to identify signal values.

```python
>>> cusum(s, 0.2, 0.4)
[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```
