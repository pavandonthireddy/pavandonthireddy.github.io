## Abstract 

<p align="justify">Prewhitening has been used to eliminate the influence of serial correlation on the Mann-
Kendall (MK) test in trend-detection studies of hydrological time series. However, its ability to
accomplish such a task has not been well documented. This study investigates this issue by Monte
Carlo simulation. Simulated time series consist of a linear trend and a lag 1 autoregressive (AR(1))
process with a noise. Simulation results demonstrate that when trend exists in a time series, the
effect of positive/negative serial correlation on the MK test is dependent upon sample size,
magnitude of serial correlation, and magnitude of trend. When sample size and magnitude of trend
are large enough, serial correlation no longer significantly affects the MK test statistics. </p>

<p align="justify">Removal of
positive AR(1) from time series by prewhitening will remove a portion of trend and hence reduces
the possibility of rejecting the null hypothesis while it might be false. Contrarily, removal of
negative AR(1) by prewhitening will inflate trend and leads to an increase in the possibility of
rejecting the null hypothesis while it might be true. Therefore, prewhitening is not suitable for
eliminating the effect of serial correlation on the MK test when trend exists within a time
series.
