# Introduction

The Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) algorithm is a signal processing technique used for extracting modes from signals. It is based on the concept of representing a signal as a sum of oscillatory components, with each component having a specific frequency and amplitude. The VMD algorithm is commonly used in applications such as biomedical signal analysis and image processing.

In this article, we will provide an overview of the VMD algorithm, its mathematical formulation, and provide a Python implementation for extracting modes from a signal.

# Mathematical Formulation

The VMD algorithm involves minimizing a cost function, which is defined as the sum of the squared differences between the signal and its reconstructed version using the extracted modes. The cost function is subject to a constraint that ensures that the mode functions are smooth and oscillatory.

Let's consider a signal $x(t)$ that is represented as the sum of $K$ oscillatory components or modes $u_k(t)$, that are extracted using the VMD algorithm. Each mode $u_k(t)$ has a specific frequency $\omega_k$ and amplitude $a_k$. The VMD algorithm aims to find the modes $u_k(t)$ that best represent the signal $x(t)$.

The cost function for the VMD algorithm can be written as:

$$
\min_{z,u} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \| z_k - D_k u_k \|^2_2 + \lambda \sum_{k=1}^{K-1} \| \mu_k \|_{TV}
$$

where $z_k$ is the $k^{th}$ analytic signal of $x(t)$, $D_k$ is a diagonal matrix containing the Fourier coefficients corresponding to the $k^{th}$ frequency band, $\mu_k$ is the difference between adjacent mode functions, $\lambda$ is a regularization parameter that controls the smoothness of the modes, and $TV$ denotes the total variation.

The optimization problem can be solved using an alternating minimization algorithm, which involves alternating between updating the mode functions and the auxiliary variables. The mode functions are updated using a fixed-point iteration method that involves solving a constrained least squares problem. The auxiliary variables are updated using a soft-thresholding operation.

# Python Implementation

Let's now see how we can implement the VMD algorithm in Python.

First, we need to import the required libraries:

``` python
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import hilbert
from scipy.sparse import diags
from scipy.sparse.linalg import spsolve
```

Next, we define a function to calculate the total variation of a given signal:

``` python
def total_variation(x):
    diff = np.diff(x)
    return np.sum(np.sqrt(diff**2 + 1e-12))
```

We then define a function to extract the modes from a given signal using the VMD algorithm:

``` python
def vmd(x, K, alpha=200, tol=1e-7, maxiter=500):
    N = len(x)
    t = np.arange(N) / N

    lamda = alpha*(N/2)
    mu = np.ones(K-1)

    for i in range(maxiter):
        u = np.zeros((K, N))
        uhat = np.zeros((K, N), dtype=complex)
        uhat_sum = np.zeros(N, dtype=complex)

        for k in range(K):
            uhat[k, :] = np.fft.fft(np.multiply(np.exp(np.sum(mu[:k])*t), x))
            uhat_sum += uhat[k, :]

        for k in range(K):
            v = uhat_sum - uhat[k, :]
            d = 1 / (lamda + np.sum(np.abs(D_hat)))

            uhat[k, :] = d * (v + D_hat * uhat[k, :])
            u[k, :] = np.real(np.fft.ifft(uhat[k, :]))

        for k in range(K-1):
            mu[k] = np.maximum(0, total_variation(np.diff(u[k, :])) - 1/lamda)

        if np.all(np.abs(u-uold) < tol):
            break

        uold = u

    return u
```

Finally, we can use the above function to extract the modes from a signal:

``` python
# Generate a sample signal
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
x = 2 * np.sin(2*np.pi*3*t) + np.sin(2*np.pi*5*t) + 0.5*np.sin(2*np.pi*11*t) + 0.25*np.sin(2*np.pi*19*t)

# Extract modes using VMD
K = 4
u = vmd(x, K)

# Plot the extracted modes
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axs = plt.subplots(K, 1, figsize=(10, 10))

for k in range(K):
    axs[k].plot(t, u[k])
    axs[k].set_xlim([t[0], t[-1]])
    axs[k].set_xlabel('Time')
    axs[k].set_ylabel('Amplitude')
    axs[k].set_title(f'Mode {k+1}')
```
