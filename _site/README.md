# Pavan Donthireddy's digital garden 

This is a space where I save my thoughts, ideas, and notes in a nonlinear way. Think of it as a collection of interconnected and ever-growing notes that reflect my curiosity, interests, and ongoing learning process. Unlike a blog, where each post is a standalone piece of content that follows a certain format, a digital garden is more like a living document that I update and refine over time. Some of the notes may be rough and incomplete, while others may be more developed and polished. This diversity reflects the different stages and contexts of my thinking, and I invite you to explore it freely and make your own connections and interpretations.
